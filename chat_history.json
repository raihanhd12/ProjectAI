Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n1. **Fish Handling and Storage**: The text mentions handling and storing fish in controlled environments, including using ships for loading, transporting, storing, cooling, processing, or preserving them. This indicates that fish are managed in a way that involves multiple steps from capture to consumption.\n\n2. **Potential Impact on Fish Health**: There is a mention of potential disruptions to fish health management, particularly bacterial diseases. These issues can affect both aquaculture and broader environmental and human health contexts.\n\n3. **Microbial Resistance Management**: The context highlights the need for safe, effective, quality-assured, and affordable antimicrobial agents to minimize the emergence and spread of resistant microorganisms. This suggests a focus on preventing antibiotic resistance in fish farming practices.\n\n4. **Surveillance**: Surveillance is described as collecting data through field sampling or specimen collection to monitor disease spread, prevalence, and severity. This practice helps in understanding and managing diseases effectively.\n\n5. **Fish Farming Practices**: The text reiterates that fish farming involves maintaining, raising, breeding, and harvesting fish in controlled environments, including the use of ships for various operations.\n\nIn summary, the context is discussing comprehensive practices related to fish farming, emphasizing the importance of handling, storage, health management, surveillance, and the prevention of antimicrobial resistance. These measures are crucial for ensuring sustainable and safe aquaculture practices that do not compromise environmental or public health.", "timestamp": "2025-03-05T09:28:35.058046", "sources": ["-2024permenkp031_1733620026.pdf"], "source_metadata": [{"source": "-2024permenkp031_1733620026.pdf", "relevance": 0.7488152506982657, "page": 1, "file_type": "pdf", "date_processed": "2025-03-05 09:27:56"}]}], "timestamp": "2025-03-05T09:27:29.749004", "app_mode": "RAG Chat"}}
